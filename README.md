# Smart-Home-Controller
This project is a Java-based Smart Home Controller system developed as part of my Software Engineering course (CS 415). It demonstrates the implementation of multiple object-oriented design patterns to simulate a real-world smart home environment where users can control various devices like lights, air conditioners, and doors.
